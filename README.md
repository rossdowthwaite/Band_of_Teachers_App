Band Of Teachers Application
============================

The unfinished beginnings of a web application for Band of Teachers Music tuition services. 

Written in pure PHP and MySQL before discovering web frameworks such as Rails or Lavarel in the summer of 2011.

This app was the prototype and testing ground for my Dissertation project "Intuition" developed using Ruby on Rails.
