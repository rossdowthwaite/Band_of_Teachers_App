Band of Teachers Application
============================

The unfinished beginnings of a web application for Band of Teachers Music tuition services.

Written in pure PHP and MySQL in the summer of 2011 before moving to web frameworks such as Rails or Lavarel.

This app was the prototype and testing ground for my Dissertation project "Intuition" developed using Ruby on Rails. A great learning experience in PHP and MySQL but highlights the efficiency of Web frameworks and ORM.

Implemented Functionality
-------------------------
- Login and User Authentication
- User Types, permissions and redirection.
- Form Validations
- Database Validations and Checks
