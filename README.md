Band Of Teachers Application
============================

A web unfinished application for students to find a music teacher and keep track of their tuition written in pure PHP and MySQL during the period before discovering web frameworks and ORM's such as Rails or Lavarel in the summer of 2011

This app was the prototype and testing ground for my Dissertation project "Intuition" developed using Ruby on Rails.
